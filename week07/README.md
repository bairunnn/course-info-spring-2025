## Assignments

- [Assignment 02](https://github.com/Weitzman-MUSA-GeoCloud/assignment02)
- Watch the [week 8 video](https://share.descript.com/view/Uw9egXI9m9T)
  - Please note while watching this one that Google rebreanded Cloud Functions some time last summer (https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/release-notes#August_21_2024). The new name is Cloud Run Functions, but it's the same product. Some parts of the interface may look different than in the video (particularly in the part around testing), but the functionality is the same.

#### Parquet files in Python
Apache Arrow is a cross-language development platform for in-memory data. It specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware.

#### Parquet files in Node.js
DuckDB is an in-memory analytical database (similar to `DataFrame`s in Pandas or R). It has libraries for many languages; I recommend the `duckdb-async` library for Node.js.
