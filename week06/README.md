## Code Samples

In the [explore_phila_data/](explore_phila_data/) directory you'll find extract and prepare scripts for a few datasets. I recommend reviewing them in this order:

- Extract & prepare scripts for PWD Parcels (the parcels are downloaded as a GeoJSON file).
- Extract & prepare scripts for L&I Permits (the permits are downloaded as a GeoPackage).
- Extract & prepare scripts for OPA Properties (the properties are downloaded as a CSV file with EPSG:2272 coords).
- Extract & prepare scripts for SEPTA Bus and Rail data (the GTFS file requires some ... interesting code).

## In-class Exercise

Continue working on the [BigQuery & Carto](../week05/exercises/ex_load_data_into_bigquery.md) exercise. Refer to the tips in the previous week's README for help.

## Assignments

- [Assignment 02](https://github.com/Weitzman-MUSA-GeoCloud/assignment02)
- Read the following chapters(access books through [O'Reilly for Higher Education](http://hdl.library.upenn.edu.proxy.library.upenn.edu/1017/7026/1)):
    * **Data Pipelines Pocket Reference**  
      *Chapter 3: Common Data Pipeline Patterns*

    * **Designing Data-Intensive Applications**  
      *Chapter 3: Storage and Retrieval* **Only the second section (_Transaction Processing or Analytics?_) is necessary.**

      About the other _optional_ sections:  
      The first section (*Data Structures That Power Your Database*) goes in to a lot more detail about the types of indexing we were discussing this week, and the last section (*Column-Oriented Storage*) covers things we'll see in the next few weeks, but in more detail than we'll go into in class. They are optional, but feel free to read them if you enjoy technical details.

## From the lecture...

- Cal-ITP Code:
  - gtfs-rt-archiver is the tool that fetches GTFS-RT data from agencies around CA every 20 seconds: https://github.com/cal-itp/data-infra/tree/main/services/gtfs-rt-archiver-v3
  - gtfs-rt-parser is the script that gets run every hour from Airflow, validates the RT feed data, and converts it to JSON-L: https://github.com/cal-itp/data-infra/tree/main/jobs/gtfs-rt-parser-v2 (e.g. [this is the definition of the task](https://github.com/cal-itp/data-infra/blob/main/airflow/dags/parse_and_validate_rt_v2/parse_rt_vehicle_positions.yml) that runs that script from within Airflow)
